# Text classification tree model

- Task: Text binary/multi classification
- Base model: Tree model(e.g. DecisionTree, RandomForest, XGBoost)
- Input data
    - Binary: Naver sentiment movie corpus
    - Multiple
- Output data
    - Binary: Positive/Negative
    - Multiple
- Period: 2022.04.13 - 2022.05.13
- Implementation plan
    1. Build a minimal viable text classification model
    2. Train the model and set up the baseline score
    3. Build a data pipeline
    4. Automate the process of training and evaluating the model on the data
    5. Choose other advanced tree model and implement it on process
    6. Compare the performance of the model with the baseline score
